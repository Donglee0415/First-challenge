# HTML and CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Background
* This is my first challenge for HTML and CSS


## User Story
* AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Change Applied
* Change title concise but include more message.
* Add semantic codes like (header,nav,main,article,section, aside, footer).
* Heading attributes are sequential order.
* Add 'alt' attributes to in case of image is not load.
* Elements follow a logical structure.

## Extra Information
* Write comments on CSS to find easy and more information.
* Make application's links all function correctly.
